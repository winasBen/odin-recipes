      This recipe was shared with me by a special friend in Atlanta, GA. It has
      long been a favorite, and everyone who tastes it says it is the best they
      have ever had.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (1 pound) sweet potato</li>
      <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil sweet potato whole in skin for 40 to 50 minutes, or until done. Run
        cold water over the sweet potato, and remove the skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break apart sweet potato in a bowl. Add butter, and mix well with mixer.
        Stir in sugar, milk, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla. Beat on medium
        speed until mixture is smooth. Pour filling into an unbaked pie crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 to 60 minutes, or until
        knife inserted in center comes out clean. Pie will puff up like a
        souffle, and then will sink down as it cools.
      </li>
    </ol>
